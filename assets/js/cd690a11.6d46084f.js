They represent the value of an underlying staking asset and the rewards that asset has accrued. LSDs appreciate in value at the yield rate of their underlying staked assets. Unlike staked assets, LSDs can be traded freely and are excellent candidates to be Diversified Proof of Stake assets. Because they represent an already staked asset, they are an attractive source of increased yield when staked on a different chain, combining the underlying staking yield with the rewards produced through the Diversified Proof of Stake mechanism.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"diversified-proof-of-stake-concept/README":{"id":"diversified-proof-of-stake-concept/README","title":"Diversified Proof of Stake Concept","description":"Staking is the process of locking up a crypto asset to provide economic stability and power the block production of a proof-of-stake blockchain. By default, PoS blockchains support only one asset for staking, known as the native asset.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"diversified-proof-of-stake-concept/tenet-cross-chain-security-with-lsds":{"id":"diversified-proof-of-stake-concept/tenet-cross-chain-security-with-lsds","title":"TENET Cross-Chain Security with LSDs","description":"Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) can be used to create economic alliances between chains, resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship for all participants. By staking LSDs from other chains, users can earn staking rewards on the new chain, while simultaneously maintaining their stake on the original chain.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"diversified-proof-of-stake-implementation/adding-new-lsds-as-diversified-proof-of-stake-assets":{"id":"diversified-proof-of-stake-implementation/adding-new-lsds-as-diversified-proof-of-stake-assets","title":"Adding new LSDs as Diversified Proof of Stake assets","description":"Once the Diversified Proof of Stake module is activated, native stakers can decide which assets they want to add to the blockchain. A proposal can then be created and submitted to the blockchain\'s governance system. This proposal contains a title, description, and the following information:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"diversified-proof-of-stake-implementation/README":{"id":"diversified-proof-of-stake-implementation/README","title":"Diversified Proof of Stake Implementation","description":"The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building blockchains that has been extensively battle-tested and is extremely powerful. It provides a customizable and modular infrastructure that can be leveraged to create innovative blockchain features, such as Diversified Proof of Stake, without requiring the development of an entire blockchain architecture from scratch.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"diversified-proof-of-stake-implementation/what-assets-can-be-staked":{"id":"diversified-proof-of-stake-implementation/what-assets-can-be-staked","title":"What assets can be staked?","description":"Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) from other chains can be staked on a chain with the Diversified Proof of Stake module. Once staked, the asset starts accruing staking rewards. Like native staking assets, Diversified Proof of Stake assets can be staked, unstaked, or redelegated to different validators. They are also subject to an unbonding period after unstaking. Staking a Diversified Proof of Stake asset is as seamless as staking a native asset for the user.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"governance":{"id":"governance","title":"Governance","description":"The governance system has full control over the updated parameters of Diversified Proof of Stake. Any new LSDs must first undergo a governance process by the stakers of existing assets in the Tenet governance system. Staked LSDs earn network rewards and can be used for voting purposes in governance.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Diversified PoS \u2014 Tenet","description":"Proof of Stake is now cemented as the preferred consensus model for new blockchain adopters. The reduced fees and increased scalability it brings enable powerful smart contract economies. As a bonus, its low carbon impact appeals to corporations and mass media, which boost the odds of accelerated mainstream adoption.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"understanding-diversified-proof-of-stake":{"id":"understanding-diversified-proof-of-stake","title":"Understanding Diversified Proof of Stake","description":"Diversified Proof of Stake allows network consensus to be reached by validators that stake a basket of assets. This removes the risk of the network being owned by a large controller of a single asset. The probability of network attack reduces exponentially with each new asset class needed to maintain network control.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"using-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsds":{"id":"using-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsds","title":"Using Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)","description":"The Tenet basket of validation assets uses staked Proof of Stake assets. Therefore, Tenet accepts liquid staking derivatives such as those minted via protocols like Lido and RocketPool or even institutions like Binance and Coinbase.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}')}}]);
